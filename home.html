<p>Rose went away, so the Doctor was <b>blue.</b></br>
Ask Donna, "Where's the Doctor?"</br>
She'll reply, "Doctor who?"</br>
Sarah Jane, and then Martha, and then both the Ponds</br>
Had their fun with the Doctor but now they've all gone.</br>
So if you want to know why the Tardis is blue...</br>
There's a sad man inside with both hearts torn in two.</p>
Let me bleed you this song of my heart deformed.</br>
Lead you along this path in the dark, where I belong 'till I feel your warmth.</br>
Let me weep you this poem as Heaven's Gates close. Paint you my soul, scarred and alone.</br>
Waiting for your kiss to take me back home.</br>
Hold me like you held onto life when all fears came alive and entombed me.</br>
Love me like you loved the sun scorching the blood in my Vampire heart.</p>
<p>I stole myself a Time Lord, a Doctor of time and peace.</br>
A man who lived thousands of years, who often changed his face.</br>
We soon became the best of friends, saw all there was to see.</br>
The beginning of time and the end of days, from the mountains to the sea.</br>
We picked up a few strays here or there, who went along for the ride.</br>
Some stayed some left and some fell in love... and some of them have died.</br>
But through it all, one thing remains, a fact which will always be...</br>
I need that raggedy Doctor just as much as he needs me.</p>
